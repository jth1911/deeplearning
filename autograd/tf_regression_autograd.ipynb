    "# Using Autograd in TensorFlow to Solve a Regression Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually use TensorFlow to build a neural network. However, TensorFlow is not limited to this. Behind the scenes, TensorFlow is a tensor library with automatic differentiation capability. Hence you can easily use it to solve a numerical optimization problem with gradient descent, which is the algorithm to train a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow 2.x, you can define variables and constants as TensorFlow objects and build an expression with them. The expression is essentially a function of the variables. Hence you may derive its derivative function, i.e., the differentiation or the gradient. This feature is one of the many fundamental features in TensorFlow. The deep learning model will make use of this in the training loop.\n",

    "Let’s consider a case where you have a polynomial in the form of y = f(x), and you are given several (x, y) samples. How can you recover the polynomial f(x)? One way is to assume random coefficients for the polynomial and feed in the samples (x, y). If the polynomial is found, you should see the value of y matches f(x). The closer they are, the closer your estimate is to the correct polynomial. This is indeed a numerical optimization problem such that you want to minimize the difference between y and f(x). You can use gradient descent to solve it. Let’s consider an example. You can build a polynomial f(x) = x^2 + 2^x + 3 in NumPy as follows:\n",

Such an array is built from the vector X using the np.hstack() function. Similarly, we build the TensorFlow constant y from the NumPy array Y. Afterwards, you use a for-loop to run gradient descent in 1,000 iterations. In each iteration, you compute x × w. in matrix form to find Ax^2 + Bx + C and assign it to the variable y_pred. Then, compare y. and y_pred and find the mean square error. Next, derive the gradient, i.e., the rate of change of the mean square error with respect to the coefficients w.

    "Note the way the gradient tape is asked to produce the gradient: You ask the gradient of sqerr respective to A, B, C, and D. Hence four gradients are found. You then apply each gradient to the respective variables in each iteration. Rather than looking for the gradient in four different calls to tape.gradient(), this is required in TensorFlow because the gradient of sqerr can only be recalled once by default"
